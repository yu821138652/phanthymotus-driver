# Phanthy Motus Drivers

[中文文档](README_zh.md) | [Official Website](https://motus.phanthy.com)

Hardware drivers for the **[Phanthy Motus](https://github.com/4paradigm/phanthymotus)** embodied AI platform.

Each driver is a standalone [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) HTTP server that exposes hardware capabilities as tools. Drivers automatically register with the [Phanthy Motus Agent Core](https://github.com/4paradigm/phanthymotus) on startup.

## Available Drivers

| Driver | Hardware | Port | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| `unitree/g1` | Unitree G1 Humanoid | 15701 | Locomotion, arm control, mic, speaker, LED, state monitoring |
| `phanthy/remote_control` | Remote Control Bridge | 15710 | Remote control relay |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker (ARM64)
- A running [Phanthy Motus Agent Core](https://github.com/4paradigm/phanthymotus) instance

### Deploy via Web Dashboard (Recommended)

The easiest way to deploy a driver is through the Agent Core Web Dashboard. Navigate to **Deploy** in the top menu — you can browse reviewed and published driver versions, select a version, and deploy with one click. No manual build required.

### Build & Deploy Your Own Driver

If you need to build from source or develop a custom driver:

```bash
cp .env.example .env  # Fill in registry credentials

# Build a specific driver
./build.sh unitree/g1
```

When run without arguments, `build.sh` shows an interactive multi-select menu to choose which drivers to build. You can also pass driver paths directly for CI usage:

```bash
# Build multiple drivers
./build.sh unitree/g1 phanthy/remote_control
```

Once the driver container starts, it registers itself with Agent Core at `http://<agent-core>:15678/api/mcp`. You can then see the device and its tools in the Web Dashboard.

### Run Locally (without Docker)

```bash
cd unitree/g1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## How It Works

1. Driver starts as an MCP HTTP server on its designated port
2. Driver sends a registration request to Agent Core
3. Agent Core discovers the driver's tools via MCP `initialize` and `tools/list`
4. Tools become available to the LLM agent and appear in the Web Dashboard
5. The LLM agent can invoke tools via MCP `tools/call`

## Writing a New Driver

Want to add support for new hardware? See the **[Driver Development Guide](README_dev.md)** for the full specification, including:

- MCP protocol implementation (JSON-RPC 2.0 methods)
- Tool definition spec (`inputSchema`, `configSchema`, `multiInstance`, `x-action-params`)
- Instance management (`multiInstance` flag, `scope` for config fields)
- Plugin lifecycle (`__init__`, `get_tool`, `start`, `stop`, `dispatch`)
- `driver.yaml` and `config.yaml` metadata format
- Registration and heartbeat with Agent Core
- Port allocation (15700–15799 range)

Quick overview:
- Each driver implements MCP JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP (`initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`)
- Tool naming convention: `{device}_{action}` (e.g., `loco_move`, `mic_start`)
- Driver port range: **15700–15799**

### Topic Inference via `info` Action

**All** tools that produce or consume ROS2 topics must implement an `info` action. The Agent Core canvas calls `info(instance_id, input_topic)` immediately after a card is placed or wired, and uses the returned `topic_out`/`topic_in` as the **authoritative** topic path. Static definitions in `tool.topic_out` are used only as a fallback when `info()` is unavailable.

**Rule: driver owns topic path logic; canvas only reads the result.**

| Tool type | `info()` input | `topic_out` computation |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|
| Static sensor (mic, imu, camera…) | — | Return fixed `self._topic` |
| multiInstance sensor (ext_mic, ext_camera) | `instance_id` | `/{namespace}/{tool}/{instance_id}/…` (replace `-` → `_`) |
| Processor (asr, tts) | `input_topic` | `{input_topic}/{tool_name}` |

Example for a static sensor:
```python
def dispatch(self, action: str, args: dict) -> dict | None:
    if action == "info":
        return {"state": self.state, "topic_out": [{"topic": self._topic, "format": "audio/pcm-16k"}]}
    return None
```

> **Note:** ROS2 topic names only allow alphanumerics, `_`, `~`, `{`, `}`. Canvas card IDs
> contain hyphens (e.g. `card-abc123`), so drivers must sanitize `instance_id` before
> embedding it in a topic path: `instance_id.replace('-', '_')`.

The Agent Core canvas calls this endpoint immediately after a card is placed or wired,
so output port labels are populated without waiting for `start`.

## Data Rendering in Agent Core Dashboard

The Agent Core Web Dashboard renders live data streams based on the `format` field declared in a tool's `topic_out`. Each format is matched to a specialized renderer:

| Format | Renderer | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `audio/pcm-16k` | Audio waveform | PCM audio visualizer with playback |
| `video/mjpeg` | Video stream | Motion JPEG video display |
| `image/jpeg` | Image | Static JPEG image |
| `image/depth-z16` | Depth colormap | 16-bit depth image with color mapping |
| `data/json` | Text / KV panel | JSON key-value display |
| `text/*` | Text | Plain text display |
| `sensor/skeleton` | 3D Skeleton | URDF-based 3D skeleton with joint rotation |
| `sensor/lidar*` | Lidar scan | 2D/3D lidar point visualization |
| `sensor/pointcloud` | Point cloud | 3D point cloud renderer |
| `sensor/mapping` | 2D Map | Occupancy grid / SLAM map |
| `sensor/htmsg` | HT message | Custom structured message |

### Skeleton Rendering (`sensor/skeleton`)

For robot state monitoring, declare `"format": "sensor/skeleton"` in `topic_out`. The dashboard will:

1. Call your driver's `model` tool (type: `resource`) to fetch the URDF
2. Parse the URDF kinematic chain in the browser
3. Render a 3D skeleton with joint positions from the URDF
4. Apply real-time joint angles from `sensor/skeleton` topic data

**Requirements for skeleton support:**

- A `model` tool (type `resource`) that returns `{"urdf": "<URDF XML>"}` via MCP
- A `joints` tool (type `sensor`) with `topic_out` format `sensor/skeleton`
- Joint data published as `{"joints": [{"idx": 0, "name": "joint_name", "q": angle}, ...]}`
- **Joint names in data must match URDF joint names exactly** (e.g., `FL_hip_joint` not `FL_hip`)
- **`dispatch()` must return a plain dict** (e.g. `{"urdf": "..."}`) — do NOT return pre-wrapped MCP content arrays (see README_dev.md § "dispatch() Return Value Format")

## Audio Requirements for ASR Compatibility

Any driver that publishes audio for use with the Perception ASR plugin must meet the following requirements. Failure to comply will result in the ASR receiving audio but producing no output (the VAD silently discards non-conforming frames).

### ROS2 Message Type

```
audio_msgs/AudioChunk
  std_msgs/Header header
  string format          # must be exactly "audio/pcm-16k"
  uint8[] data           # raw PCM bytes
```

### PCM Format

| Parameter | Required value |
|-----------|---------------|
| Encoding | 16-bit signed integer, little-endian (PCM_S16_LE) |
| Sample rate | **16 000 Hz** |
| Channels | **Mono (1 channel)** |
| `format` field | `"audio/pcm-16k"` |

### Chunk Size

| Parameter | Constraint |
|-----------|-----------|
| Minimum | **1 024 bytes** (512 samples ≈ 32 ms) |
| Recommended | 1 024 – 4 096 bytes (32 – 128 ms) |

Chunks smaller than 1 024 bytes are **silently discarded** by the VAD. This is the most common cause of "ASR receives audio but never outputs text."

### The 48 kHz USB Mic Pitfall

Most USB audio interfaces capture at 48 000 Hz natively. After downsampling to 16 000 Hz, a 512-frame ALSA period yields only **170 samples (340 bytes)** — below the minimum. You must accumulate resampled output into a buffer and only publish when 512 samples are ready:

```python
TARGET = 1024  # bytes — 512 int16 samples @ 16 kHz
_buf = bytearray()

# Inside the capture loop, after resampling to 16 kHz:
_buf += resampled_bytes
while len(_buf) >= TARGET:
    chunk, _buf = bytes(_buf[:TARGET]), _buf[TARGET:]
    msg = AudioChunk()
    msg.format = "audio/pcm-16k"
    msg.data = list(chunk)
    publisher.publish(msg)
```

This pattern is already applied to the `ext_mic` plugin in `unitree/g1/ext_devices.py`.
